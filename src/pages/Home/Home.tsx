              When you support girls in Scouting, youâ€™re investing in courage,
              confidence, and character. From building outdoor skills to leading
              service projects, girls in Scouting are learning to tackle
              challenges, make a difference in their communities, and grow into
              strong, capable leaders. Your support helps provide them with the
              tools, mentorship, and opportunities they need to thrive.
